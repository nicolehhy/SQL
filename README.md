### Background
When I was a Data Analyst Intern in InKe(a Chinese mobile app allowing users to watch live video broadcast on smartphones), I was mainly in charge of data pulls, data cleaning and building dashboards. I was also responsible for developing various KPIs of the key businees performance indicators that everyone else can use to taclke businees problems.  <br>

The following are parts of the takses I touched during the internship. Most of them needed to understand what problem it is, what kind of data I need, how to get them, how to make sure the data integraty and develope some valuable insights through data visulization using Tableau thus to communicate with other departments on some projects more effectively.
